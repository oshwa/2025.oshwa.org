The Mothbox is a low-cost, open source, and high-performance insect monitor. It features a power-efficient and lightweight design meant to help field biologists deploy it in various environments, including the depths of the jungle. In this talk, the Digital Naturalism Laboratories team will describe the design and functionalities of the Mothbox, how open source technologies unlock new modes of working together on conservation projects, and our plans for the future.
