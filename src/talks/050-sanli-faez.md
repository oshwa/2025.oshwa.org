In the FAIR-Battery project, we aim to create an open-source electrochemical battery (FAIR = Findable + Accessible + Interoperable + Reproducible). We seek to present an open-hardware platform for a versatile battery technology and make the platform radically accessible: 1- by deliberately using low-cost and locally available materials suitable for local user groups, and 2- by setting up the education communities on top of the open-hardware design.
