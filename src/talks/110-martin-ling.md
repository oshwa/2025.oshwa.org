When manufacturing an electronic product you really need to develop two products: the device you produce, and the factory test system for it. The test system can often be the harder of the two, but is usually a private project, likely put together in a hurry, and rarely open sourced – even for open source products. Learning to build effective and economical factory test systems can be a major hurdle for newcomers. I’ll discuss the requirements for an effective test system, and present a case study of how we planned and built the test for Great Scott Gadgets’ USB multi-tool, Cynthion.
