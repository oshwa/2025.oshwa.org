This talk shares the inspiring journey of Quetzal-1, Guatemala’s first satellite, developed by a team of 100+ students, volunteers, and engineers with an average age of 21. Building the country’s first satellite posed challenges: limited know-how, tight budgets, and developing 70% of the hardware from scratch. The talk highlights the key role of open-source hardware and software and our commitment to paying it forward. So far, we’ve released hardware/software design files, a full telemetry dataset, and three peer-reviewed papers detailing the satellite’s subsystems and performance.
