Did you know that protein can be grown using just electricity and carbon dioxide, with a fraction of the land, water, and emissions required by traditional farming? By harnessing hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, we’re creating an open-source bioreactor for small-scale protein production. This technology could allow anyone to produce protein at home, without the need for large factories. In this talk, we’ll discuss how open-source hardware and community collaboration can make microbial protein fermentation accessible, helping to shape a more sustainable future for food production.
