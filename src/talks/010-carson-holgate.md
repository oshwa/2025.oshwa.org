AYAB is an open source hardware and software project to retrofit vintage knitting machines to be controlled by computer. We support electronic Brother knitting machines from the 80's and 90's. AYAB's custom hardware replaces the original electronics so we can revive knitting machines when the original hardware no longer works. We face some interesting challenges supporting a group of end users who are largely non-technical and a group of contributors who largely don't knit.
