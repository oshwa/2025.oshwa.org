What if we could print interactive devices on the 3D printers we already have? This talk will give an overview of a project called Printegrated Circuits, a technique we've been developing to embed PCBs into FFF 3D prints, combining conductive and insulating filament to make interesting resistive and capacitive sensing structures in unique forms. We'll dive into the details of generating custom GCode from PCB design files and the design of novel sensors in cute set of demos.
