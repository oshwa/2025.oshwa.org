Severe degradation of ecosystems calls for their conservation. Data is essential for effective conservation efforts. However, traditional methods of data collection are often inefficient. Advances in technology have led to the development of open-source boards that can be interfaced with sensors for efficient data collection. At the Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL), we are actively developing sensors for environmental data collection in Africa to address the challenge of insufficient data in the African context.
