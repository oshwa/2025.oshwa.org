KiCad is the most popular electronics CAD tool and ships the biggest open library of electronic components. The libraries are maintained by a handful of volunteers. We librarians sit at the intersection point between hundreds of contributors and hundreds of thousands of users.

Contributions come in every day. They never stop. We built a combination of technology, policy, and community to handle this. Here's how we messed up, how we gained productivity through mental health, and how we keep up in the face of constantly increasing contribution volumes and an industry that doesn't care about consistency or correctness.
