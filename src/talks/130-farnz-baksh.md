Social robots have transformed eldercare, childcare, pet care… What about student care? 
Born amidst the COVID pandemic, the open-source Robot Study Companion (RSC; OSHWA UID: EE000003) sets the bar by helping students stay organised, motivated, and ready to learn with an open-source, low-cost research-backed design and a growing contributor community. 

We will discuss the RSC prototype, how you can benefit from it, recent developments, and ongoing research. Take part in the movement, share your ideas, and help empower students with DIY open social robots!
