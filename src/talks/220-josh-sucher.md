As an artist whose work often marries modern and vintage tech, I've come across many keepers of the flame: the folks whose singular passion and commitment to documenting, evangelizing, reverse-engineering, maintaining repos and Discords for, and developing open hardware add-ons for their specific old platform of choice has made it possible for me to dive in thirty, forty, fifty years later. In each of my projects there's been at least one individual whose invisible labor has made my work possible. I'm here to celebrate these folks, while learning more about what motivates them and share their stories.
