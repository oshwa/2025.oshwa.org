Consumer technology is filled with precise, fast, and inexpensive sensors taking constant measurements of the world. Hobbyist electronics sites have taken many of these engineering marvels and provided easy to use breakout boards and libraries for integration into self-directed projects. The ability to measure our environment is a cornerstone of the physical sciences and consumer sensors have the potential to completely change who and where has access to these tools. But there is still a large chasm between a sensor example script and a scientific instrument. This talk explores examples of successful open science hardware projects and how user interfaces, data processing, and calibration can turn sensor breakout boards into a powerful measurement tool.
