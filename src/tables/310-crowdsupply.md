Crowd Supply is a curated, full-service crowdfunding and incubation platform for hardware creators.

We launch projects, accept orders, market products, support customers, process payments, handle accounting, ship packages, distribute to partners, manage inventory, and deal with all the painful operational details along the way. Crowd Supply is paid based on a percentage of product sales during the campaign (typically 12%) and does not take equity.
