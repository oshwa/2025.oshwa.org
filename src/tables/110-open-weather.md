Open-weather is a feminist experiment in imaging and imagining the earth and its weather systems using DIY tools. We weave speculative storytelling with low cost hardware and open-source software to transform our relations to a planet in climate crisis.

Co-led by Soph Dyer and Sasha Engelmann since 2020, open-weather makes artworks, leads inclusive workshops and develops resources on satellite imagery reception and reading. Through these activities, a network has formed around the project, currently numbering more than one hundred DIY Satellite Ground Station operators around the world, from Buenos Aires to Berlin.​​

In the tradition of intersectional feminism, open-weather investigates the politics of location and interlocking oppressions that shape our capacities to observe, negotiate, and respond to the climate crisis. In doing so, open-weather challenges dominant representations of earth and environment while complicating ideas of the weather beyond the meteorological.

As well as working with schools and small groups, we have been commissioned by The Photographer’s Gallery (UK), Sonic Acts (NL), Nieuwe Instituut (NL), Library Stack (US), Ràdio Web MACBA (ES), Onassis Stegi (GR), Getxophoto (ES), Our Networks (CA) and Sound Camp (UK) among others.
