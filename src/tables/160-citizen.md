We need new methods to decide how we want to shape our future while respecting humans and ecosystems. Anybody should be able to collect, share and contribute environmental data and take action in environmental protection. Smart Citizen is a platform that helps do this by connecting people, data and knowledge with open source tools and technologies that are consciously designed to bring power back to the people.
