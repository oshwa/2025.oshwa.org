The Tree Imaging Machine is a tool we designed to provide a cost effective method to scan wood samples from trees in ultra-high resolution. Digitizing tree cores and cookies is a fundamental prerequisite to accurately reconstruct past climates and understand tree growth. We aim to minimize the barriers to build this scientific equipment for dendrochronology labs to focus on their research and the rest of their experimental design.
