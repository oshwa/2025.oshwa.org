We  are building a self-hosted VoIP server on a Raspberry PI to run our own telephone line, with a companion website for transcripts and audio from the service. Callers can listen to poetry and soundscapes created by queer artists, personal ads, and leave voicemails. We's bring beginner-friendly zines on self-hosting and building your own telephone line, as well as provide a call-in service just for the summit.
