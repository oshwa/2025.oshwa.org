Domestic knitting machine hacking has been around for a while and has mostly focused on the Brother Electroknit brand. Our project is different in that it uses the other main brand of knitting machine - Knitmaster. Our hack uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to transmit image files from a laptop to the knitting machine.

We will also bring along a Brother Electroknit machine with the existing AYAB hack for Brother machines, along with some examples of artwork created on the machine by local artist Madeleine Shepherd.
