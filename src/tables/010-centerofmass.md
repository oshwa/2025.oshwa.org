Our small satellite test devices: the Centre of Mass Table, which measures the centre of mass of any object up to 30 kg.

During the development and launch of EIRSAT-1, Ireland’s first satellite, we created numerous test devices for calibration, validation, and verification purposes. Our goal is to make these tools open-source, so other teams won’t need to reinvent the wheel — ultimately saving time and helping make space exploration more affordable and accessible.
