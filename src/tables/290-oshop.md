"OShop is an open-source hardware network that connects makers, engineers, and designers to collaboratively develop and share open hardware solutions. It promotes sustainable innovation through shared knowledge, open tools, and decentralized production. By fostering collaboration, OShop empowers communities to create adaptable, transparent, and accessible technology for a wide range of applications.
We will also present an open-source measuring arm. It is based on Arduino and Processing and features a modular system for quick and easy customization. Ideal for flexible measurement tasks and individual extensions."
