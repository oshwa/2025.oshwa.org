Rethinking Temporal Perception through Rewired Clocks and Water Systems challenges capitalist-driven notions of time by reconfiguring its representation through electronics, liquid pumps, and Arduino. Disrupting conventional timekeeping, the project critiques efficiency and control, inviting viewers to reconsider timeâ€™s fluidity and socio-economic influence.
