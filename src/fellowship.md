title: Open Hardware Summit Fellowship
---

The Summit Fellowship was founded in 2013 prior to the annual Open Hardware Summit at MIT by Summit Chair [Addie Wagenknecht](http://placesiveneverbeen.com/) and OSHWA Director [Alicia Gibb](http://aliciagibb.com/) as a way to encourage marginalized people in open technology and culture to actively participate and foster a more diverse community within open source. By offering the annual travel and summit conference assistance to community members, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes we as a community can encourage more women, nonbinary, trans, LGBTQA+, Black, Indigenous, people of color and disabled people to participate in open source. We have many strong leaders and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend upward.

For the ninth year, we are excited to offer up to **ten Open Hardware Fellowships** to members of the community which includes a $500 stipend, entrance to the Open Hardware Summit and mentorship opportunities leading up to the event.

        </ul>
        <p>
           Shannon Hicks is an electrical engineer at Stroud Water Research Center in Pennsylvania where she designs and builds a variety of environmental sensor data logger systems using open source hardware and software.  She's the co-founder of EnviroDIY, an online community of users who share ideas and solutions for low-cost environmental monitoring.  Shannon is also the developer of the Mayfly Data Logger, an open-source, Arduino-based board that makes it easy to build monitoring stations with sensors and telemetry modules.  She has taught dozens of workshops to a wide range of audiences about how to use open-source tools for environmental monitoring and research.

        </ul>
        <p>
           Marjia Siddik is a third-year Computer Science student at Dublin City University with a keen interest in AI safety, governance, and open-source hardware. She first became involved in open-source hardware through mentoring students at CoderDojo, where she introduced young learners to hands-on programming and hardware projects. This experience sparked her passion for accessible, community-driven innovation in technology. She has since expanded her involvement by exploring open-source tools for AI research and development. Beyond her technical interests, Marjia has published research, founded startups, and engaged in social impact initiatives. She is also a writer and has self-published her poetry book.

        </ul>
        <p>
           Deanna Gelosi is a PhD student in Creative Technology and Design at the University of Colorado Boulder within the College of Engineering and Applied Science. Her research explores computational systems for creative fabrication, and she has built software and hardware tools for clay 3D printing, digital weaving, and CNC woodworking. She integrates algorithmic aesthetics into human-machine collaboration, designing systems that foster expressivity and reflection.

At CU Boulder, she is a member of the Unstable Design Lab, and her work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the ARCS Foundation. Deanna holds a BA in Physics and an MS in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley.

        <h3>Christie Dezi</h3>

        </ul>
        <p>
           Christie is a queer artist and designer.
Through a feminist critique she experiments on biomateriality and wearables by intersecting textile innovation, costume design, biohacking and sextech.
Her artistic exploration of (trans)feminist activism and hacker culture is expressed through interactive and performative aesthetics to inspire and provoke debate and critical reflection on taboos and stigma related to sexuality, pleasure and hybrid identities.

With Giulia Tomasello she co-founded Bruixes_Lab, a nomadic laboratory where biohacking and witchcraft rituals are performed to create speculative scenarios about pleasure and experimenting with DIY sensor circuits to hack the experience of arousal and decentralise the normative binaries of sexuality and bodies.
They participated in TTT Conference in Malta, led workshops in Observatorio del Placer in BCN, Ars Elektronika in Linz, MU Hybrid Art House in Eindhoven, III Instrument Inventors in the Hague and much more..
