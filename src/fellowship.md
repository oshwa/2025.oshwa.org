title: Open Hardware Summit Fellowship
---

The Summit Fellowship was founded in 2013 prior to the annual Open Hardware Summit at MIT by Summit Chair [Addie Wagenknecht](http://placesiveneverbeen.com/) and OSHWA Director [Alicia Gibb](http://aliciagibb.com/) as a way to encourage marginalized people in open technology and culture to actively participate and foster a more diverse community within open source. By offering the annual travel and summit conference assistance to community members, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes we as a community can encourage more women, nonbinary, trans, LGBTQA+, Black, Indigenous, people of color and disabled people to participate in open source. We have many strong leaders and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend upward.

For the ninth year, we are excited to offer up to **ten Open Hardware Fellowships** to members of the community which includes a $500 stipend, entrance to the Open Hardware Summit and mentorship opportunities leading up to the event.

You can apply for the Summit Fellowship through [this form](https://forms.gle/oC4e5uDSqfG9TCuw6) until December 22nd at 11pm EST. If you prefer to not use Google Forms you are also welcome to email your responses to [adalovelacefellowship@oshwa.org](mailto:adalovelacefellowship@oshwa.org).
