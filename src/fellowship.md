title: Open Hardware Summit Fellowship
---

The Summit Fellowship was founded in 2013 prior to the annual Open Hardware Summit at MIT by Summit Chair [Addie Wagenknecht](http://placesiveneverbeen.com/) and OSHWA Director [Alicia Gibb](http://aliciagibb.com/) as a way to encourage marginalized people in open technology and culture to actively participate and foster a more diverse community within open source. By offering the annual travel and summit conference assistance to community members, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes we as a community can encourage more women, nonbinary, trans, LGBTQA+, Black, Indigenous, people of color and disabled people to participate in open source. We have many strong leaders and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend upward.

For the twelth year, we are excited to offer up to **ten Open Hardware Fellowships** to members of the community which includes a $500 stipend, entrance to the Open Hardware Summit and mentorship opportunities leading up to the event.

        <h3>Christie Dezi</h3>
        <ul class="details"></ul>
        <p>
            Christie is a queer artist and designer. Through a feminist critique she experiments on biomateriality and wearables by intersecting textile innovation, costume design, biohacking and sextech. Her artistic exploration of (trans)feminist activism and hacker culture is expressed through interactive and performative aesthetics to inspire and provoke debate and critical reflection on taboos and stigma related to sexuality, pleasure and hybrid identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Giulia Tomasello she co-founded Bruixes_Lab, a nomadic laboratory where biohacking and witchcraft rituals are performed to create speculative scenarios about pleasure and experimenting with DIY sensor circuits to hack the experience of arousal and decentralise the normative binaries of sexuality and bodies.
            They participated in TTT Conference in Malta, led workshops in Observatorio del Placer in BCN, Ars Elektronika in Linz, MU Hybrid Art House in Eindhoven, III Instrument Inventors in the Hague and much more..
