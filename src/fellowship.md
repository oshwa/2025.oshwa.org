title: Open Hardware Summit Fellowship
---

The Summit Fellowship was founded in 2013 prior to the annual Open Hardware Summit at MIT by Summit Chair [Addie Wagenknecht](http://placesiveneverbeen.com/) and OSHWA Director [Alicia Gibb](http://aliciagibb.com/) as a way to encourage marginalized people in open technology and culture to actively participate and foster a more diverse community within open source. By offering the annual travel and summit conference assistance to community members, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes we as a community can encourage more women, nonbinary, trans, LGBTQA+, Black, Indigenous, people of color and disabled people to participate in open source. We have many strong leaders and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend upward.

For the ninth year, we are excited to offer up to **ten Open Hardware Fellowships** to members of the community which includes a $500 stipend, entrance to the Open Hardware Summit and mentorship opportunities leading up to the event.

           Shannon Hicks is an electrical engineer at Stroud Water Research Center in Pennsylvania where she designs and builds a variety of environmental sensor data logger systems using open source hardware and software.  She's the co-founder of EnviroDIY, an online community of users who share ideas and solutions for low-cost environmental monitoring.  Shannon is also the developer of the Mayfly Data Logger, an open-source, Arduino-based board that makes it easy to build monitoring stations with sensors and telemetry modules.  She has taught dozens of workshops to a wide range of audiences about how to use open-source tools for environmental monitoring and research.
