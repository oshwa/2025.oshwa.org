The Opensource Workshop is an invitation to explore open-source hardware through hands-on making and shared learning. Together, we build a modular, repairable vacuum cleaner- questioning how everyday objects can be designed for longevity rather than disposability. 
The workshop is not only about the assembly of a machine, but to understand how things work, how they break, and how they can be adapted to individual needs.
(Everyone gets to keep an Opencyclone at the end.)
