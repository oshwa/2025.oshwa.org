In this workshop we will explore DIY and feminist approaches to intimate and reproductive technologies (such as menstrual trackers, pregnancy tests, biosensors). We will speculate on and discuss how the open-source hardware community can craft these technologies collectively, and think about the ethical implications and feminist utopian possibilities of free, accessible and safe technologies for all bodies.
