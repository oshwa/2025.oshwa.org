During the workshop, we invite participants to co-create soft robotics touch patterns, thinking about the texture, the placement on the body, the rhythm, and the strength.
Each group of participants create their own touches, using inflatable pads and a hardware created for controlling them, the groups decide how they want the pad to be, maybe a soft layer of fabric, or nails, to create an alarming touch.  After, we save those touches into a touch library, that allows other users to access and test this collection of touches that we are co-creating together.
