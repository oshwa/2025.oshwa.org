  bio: "\"Shih Wei-Chieh has diverse and interdisciplinary creative interests, with his works primarily focusing on the physical properties of light. His materials span electronic textiles, solar semiconductors, and laser-based audiovisual installations. He also utilizes a self-developed laser system as a creative tool. Currently, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in the Interdisciplinary Art Program at the Graduate Institute of Applied Arts, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.\nShih initiated the \"\"Tribal Against Machine\"\" project, which bridges traditional textile craftsmanship with the international electronic textile community, fostering the integration of traditional arts and technology. He is also actively involved in and facilitates international collaborations within independent art networks, establishing unconventional interdisciplinary connections. For instance, he organized the international online residency \"\"Having Friends in The Future\"\" for the National Taiwan Craftsmenship Research and Development Institute in 2020/2021. Additionally, his research project, Non-Governmental Matters, explores and investigates independent interdisciplinary art camps and gatherings, examining the positive impacts of such international and cross-disciplinary exchanges.\nShih's work has garnered international recognition. His project \"\"Laser Dye Project\"\" was awarded the grand prize at Reshape 2019 in Barcelona and featured in deTour 2019 in Hong Kong. His electronic textile piece, \"\"I Am Very Happy I Hope You Are Too,\"\" was exhibited at the Taipei Digital Art Festival and the \"\"Hello World\"\" exhibition at the University of Sydney. In 2023, his work \"\"The Mind of A Greenhouse\"\" was showcased at \"\"The Energy Giveaway at the Humuspunk Library\"\" in Zurich, an exhibition jointly organized by Hackteria and Regenerative Energy Communities.\"\""

"Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a solar technology that is relatively easy to make with low cost. The power and conversion efficiency is related to it's dyed nano porous semiconductor layers, therefore it is a intersection of art crafts and nano technology. In this workshop you will be introduced to build a simple cell with costomised color and graphics to power a small low power consumminng synthesizer.

You will get: a self-made 3x3cm DSSC-powered synthesizer.
