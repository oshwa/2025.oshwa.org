"Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a solar technology that is relatively easy to make with low cost. The power and conversion efficiency is related to it's dyed nano porous semiconductor layers, therefore it is a intersection of art crafts and nano technology. In this workshop you will be introduced to build a simple cell with costomised color and graphics to power a small low power consumminng synthesizer.

You will get: a self-made 3x3cm DSSC-powered synthesizer.
