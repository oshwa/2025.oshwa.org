In this workshop, participants will build mist-making devices using open-source hardware and recycled materials. Attendees will assemble and program mist makers that respond to their surroundings. This session highlights creative reuse, sustainability, and art-tech intersections. Participants will leave with a functional mist maker and open-source resources to continue experimenting. No prior experience requiredâ€”just curiosity and a willingness to tinker!
