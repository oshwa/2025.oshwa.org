Come join to be a part of Material Kitchenâ€™s research on discovering and unpacking the tactile potential of plant-based biomaterials! Material Kitchen is an initiative and resource for sustainable materials for physical computing and digital fabrication, initially born at ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program) at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. In this workshop, we invite you to play with conductive biomaterials based on agar agar samples to ask questions, explore ideas and applications. We will build a capacitive sensing circuit together that will turn the biomaterial into a sensitive surface that can sense your touch and presence. We will also share our material recipes that you can try at your own time.
