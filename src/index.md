# October is Open Hardware Month!

October is Open Hardware Month! Join us at [OSHWA] by [certifying hardware][certify] as open source, [becoming a member][membership], or – where it is safe due to the pandemic – hosting a small event.

We are providing resources and asking the community to host small, local events (if it’s safe) in the name of open source hardware.  We ask that you have followed OSHWA’s rules listed on the ["Dos and Don'ts" page][dos-and-donts].

## About OSHWA

The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) aims to foster technological knowledge and encourage research that is accessible, collaborative and respects user freedom. OSHWA’s primary activities include hosting the annual Open Hardware Summit and maintaining the Open Source Hardware certification, which allows the community to quickly identify and represent hardware that complies with the community definition of open source hardware.

## Open Hardware Summit

Document your project in October, then join us for the Open Hardware Summit in Montreal in 2024!
