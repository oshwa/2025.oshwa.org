## COVID

We have many members of our community we want to keep safe! With that in mind, masking during this event is strongly preferred. Also, we ask that you stay conscious of your travel path and any COVID hotspots you may move through, and test before the event if it makes sense for you.

Please consider wearing a KN95 or better. We will have some amount of masks and rapid tests available.

For your consideration, there will be eating and drinking happening at this event. Students and staff will be present in the building (though not in the event space), largely unmasked.
We will also have wearable stickers for anyone who has a preference for being masked around, to help communicate that preference. Please keep an eye out for that system.

If you are unmasked, please try to check with the comfort level of the people around you before being in close quarters.
