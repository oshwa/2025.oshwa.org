Join us at Wee Red Bar for open source performances from Mel Ho and Cristina Dezi before we move to an open mic option! If you have a performance, a device, or a project that can do something fun, interesting, loud, sound based, etc, this is the time to bring it out and show it off to your fellow OHS attendees!
Once we wrap the open mic we'll all get to hang out, chat, drink, and generally be merry!
