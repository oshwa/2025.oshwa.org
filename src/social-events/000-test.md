Alicia Seidle, OSHWA's founder and executive director, will be giving the keynote "When Your Community is Atoms Rather Than Bits" on Wednesday morning for the [Community Over Code] event.

> Open Source Hardware is what happens when your open source community is comprised of atoms rather than bits (but sometimes also bits). Learn about how the Open Source Hardware Association serves their community through diverse hardware products and projects. We will walk through the history of how open source software licenses got us to where the hardware community is today, including organizing the community around shared principles and milestones on the horizon.

[Community Over Code] is the [Apache Software Foundation]'s largest event and brings together open source enthusiasts from a broad set of topics.
