In Edinburgh, a robot is always just a stone throw away. If you'd like know the people who are making this happen or maybe you just want to make sure the robots are friendly, then this is the event you've been looking for. This time we also welcome all attendees of the Open Hardware Summit that is taking place in Edinburgh the weekend following the meetup.

It also an ospicious occasion because the official end-of-life for ROS1 is 31st May. We'll look back an forward on what ROS brought to our community and where we'll be going next.

As usual, this is your chance to socialise and network with professionals, academics and enthusiasts across Edinburgh. It is the place for you if you are looking for a drink and chat about robotics, have an interesting problem you need a second pair of eyes on, want to find out about careers in robotics, are looking for an internship, job or your next star employee, want to find a co-founder, or if you watched a movie youâ€™d like to talk about.
