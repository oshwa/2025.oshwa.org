As government, media, and public fail to adequately grapple with the scale of planetary anthropogenic heating, few if any approaches have been proposed except geoengineering. We pin our hopes on technological fixes, repeating the formula that got us into this mess. Our planetary future(s) will undoubtedly be computed, in the sense of analysis but also the computing processes (sourcing and extraction; energy and water; waste and repair) that are increasingly driving and abetting planetary change. Whether AI, Bitcoin, or space-based communications and sensing, computing is still largely about turning carbon into power.

This Cornell/Edinburgh Happening presents our playful, quixotic, speculative and counter-normative workshop outcomes that critically consider how we could introduce new ideas and concepts into our thinking around planetary and computational futures, asking how we might compute with the planet, rather than through it.
