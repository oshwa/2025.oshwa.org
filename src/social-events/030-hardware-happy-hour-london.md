Hardware Happy Hour is an informal way to socialize, show off your projects, and talk about the world of hardware. Join us upstairs at the Cat & Mutton in London Fields for drinks, hacks and snacks.

There will be a lot of interesting hardware folks in town on their way to the Open Hardware Summit, so this is a great chance to meet new people.

We welcome anyone interested in any kind of hardware from beginner to expert: Arduino DIYers, engineers, hardware start up founders, e-textile experimenters, LED-curious folks, 3D printing enthusiasts or robotics geeks.

If youâ€™re working on something even vaguely related please do feel free to bring it along.

Join us and nerd out about hardware!
