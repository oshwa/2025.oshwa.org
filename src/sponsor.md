# Sponsor the Open Hardware summit

Edinburgh, Scotland ● May 30-31, 2025 ● University of Edinburgh

<blockquote>
    <p>The Open Hardware summit is the only conference dedicated to discussing Open Source Hardware. Open Source Hardware is a community-focused method of creating where we share knowledge openly, welcome collaboration, and frequently create together. The Open Hardware summit is a place to compare notes, see the state of the art, and spend some time talking about where the open source movement is headed. The summit often contains workshops, talks, connections, mentorship.</p>

## What sets us apart

Last year, our summit included over 1,800 participants in-person and virtually. We sold out of tickets, saw 36 companies participate through sponsorship, and the summit's social feeds have over 20K followers. We pride ourselves on bringing an inclusive experience to a highly diverse community. We put people with diverse backgrounds in charge, we ensure our call for talks is spread wide to equate to a diverse population of speakers, and we have an annual summit fellowship for people from diverse backgrounds to need travel funding to participate. We've got an incredible team of organizers, and planned what we anticipate will be the best Open Hardware summit yet. But we can't do it without your help.

The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) organizes the Open Hardware summit and the open hardware community around shared values and principles. OSHWA certifies open source hardware designs, and shares data about our growing community. OSHWA's programs include the Open Hardware summit, the summit Fellowship program, Open Hardware Month in October, Certification, and it's all possible through donors like you and our membership.

Please consider supporting open hardware this year. Your donation pays our staff, ensures a diverse program through our speakers and the summit Fellowship, and ultimately helps our community network and advance their goals. Since 2013, we've helped over 100 summit fellows by various funding mechanisms and is one of our most impactful programs. Our whole community helps our Fellows attend through ticket levels, kindness, and inclusion. We've seen summit Fellows grow into open hardware employees, business owners, and speakers at future summits through the support of our community, by individuals and businesses alike.
